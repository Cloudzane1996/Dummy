RECOMMENDED STRATEGY:
Download and store PDF/EPUB versions of the top 3–4 books.
Use tools like JDownloader or wget to archive articles from blogs you follow.
Upload the saved documents to the GPT's "Knowledge" section for local referencing.

If real-time access is active (web browsing), GPT can auto-check these sources at runtime.
If not, GPT will rely on what it learns from uploaded data.

----------------------------
TIPS:
- Update this file monthly with new accounts and blogs.
- Use it to track evolving narratives (AI tokens, Real World Assets, Layer 2s, etc).
